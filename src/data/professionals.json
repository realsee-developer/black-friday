We work with clients across a range of sectors- \nincluding cultural heritage, education, exhibitions, and commercial environments-to create \nhigh-quality 3D virtual tours and interactive storytelling experiences. \nOur goal is to help organisations bring their physical spaces to wider audiences in a way that is \naccessible, meaningful, and future-ready. Whether it's a museum, a school, a branded \nshowroom, or a public venue, we focus on turning real environments into rich, navigable digital \nexperiences that connect with people. \nAs a Realsee Certified Creator, I use the Galois system to deliver clean, accurate scans and \nengaging overlays that enhance visitor understanding and interaction. I’m especially interested \nin using digital tools to support inclusive access and long-term engagement. \nFocus Areas: 3D Spatial Capture / Virtual Tours / Interactive Experiences / Education & \nExhibitions / B2B & Public Engagement / Cultural Exchange & Storytelling",
